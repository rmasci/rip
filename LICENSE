1. DEFINITIONS

   1.1 "Affiliate" means any legal entity that, directly or indirectly through
       one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under
       common control with the subject entity.

   1.2 "Change Date" means January 18, 2027.

   1.3 "Change License" means the MIT License.

   1.4 "Covered Code" has the meaning assigned to it in the Mozilla Public

       this Agreement.

   1.7 "Licensee" means the entity accepting this Agreement.

   1.8 "Non-Commercial Use" means any use or activity where the primary
       commercial purpose is not the sale, licensing, or distribution of the
       Licensed Work itself, but rather the Licensed Work is used to support
       your primary commercial purpose. However, if your primary commercial
       purpose is substantially derived from the Licensed Work, this would
       constitute Commercial Use.

   1.9 "Commercial Use" means any activity where the Licensed Work is
       leveraged, directly or indirectly, as the primary purpose of generating
       revenue or profit.

   2.1 Subject to the limitations in Section 3, Licensor hereby grants Licensee

       interest in the Licensed Work to use the Licensed Work for
       Non-Commercial Use for the term of this Agreement.

   2.2 For Commercial Use, Licensee may not use or deploy the Licensed Work
       without either:
       (a) Obtaining a separate commercial license from Licensor; or
       (b) Waiting until the Change Date.

   2.3 On the Change Date, this Agreement will automatically convert to the
       Change License, and Licensor hereby grants Licensee a license under the
       Change License to use the Licensed Work.

3. RESTRICTIONS

   3.1 Licensee may not offer the Licensed Work as a service or embed it in
